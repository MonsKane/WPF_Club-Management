# Authentication Fix Guide

## Problem Description
Users were unable to login with accounts other than `admin@university.edu` due to password hash mismatches between the database seeding process and authentication verification.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by inconsistent password hashing between:
1. The SQL seeding script (`database_seed_script.sql`)
2. The C# database initializer (`DatabaseInitializer.cs`)
3. The authentication service (`UserService.cs`)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Database Initializer
- Updated `DatabaseInitializer.cs` to ensure consistent SHA256 password hashing
- Added automatic password hash verification and fixing for existing users
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging authentication issues

### 2. Added Password Hash Verification
- All users now have their password hashes verified during database initialization
- Incorrect hashes are automatically fixed to match expected values
- Added authentication verification test after seeding

### 3. Updated SQL Script
- Fixed password hashes in `database_seed_script.sql` to match the application's hashing method
- Added documentation of passwords and their corresponding hashes

## Test Accounts

### Admin Accounts
- **Email**: `admin@university.edu`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Role**: System Administrator

- **Email**: `admin.manager@university.edu`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Role**: System Administrator

### Regular User Accounts
All regular users have the password: `password123`

- `john.doe@university.edu` - Club Owner
- `jane.smith@university.edu` - Member
- `mike.johnson@university.edu` - Member
- `sarah.wilson@university.edu` - Member
- `david.brown@university.edu` - Member
- `alice.johnson@student.edu` - Club Owner
- `michael.chen@student.edu` - Club Owner
- `kate.williams@student.edu` - Member
- `lisa.thompson@student.edu` - Member

## How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Run the Application
1. Start the application
2. The database initializer will automatically:
   - Check existing password hashes
   - Fix any incorrect hashes
   - Verify all users can authenticate
   - Display verification results in the console

### Option 2: Force Database Reset
If you want to completely reset the database:
1. Run the application with the `--reset-db` flag
2. This will delete all data and recreate it with correct password hashes

### Option 3: Use Password Hash Tester
The application includes a `PasswordHashTester` class for debugging:

```csharp
// Test password hashing
PasswordHashTester.RunPasswordTests();

// Test specific user credentials
PasswordHashTester.TestUserCredentials();
```

## Verification
After running the fix, you should see console output like:
```
[DB_VERIFY] ✅ All users can authenticate successfully!
```

If there are still issues, the console will show detailed information about which users failed authentication and why.

## Password Hash Reference
For reference, the correct SHA256 Base64 hashes are:
- `admin123` → `JAvlGPq9JyTdtvBO6x2llnRI1+gxwIyPqCKAn3THIKk=`
- `password123` → `XohImNooBHFR0OVvjcYpJ3NgPQ1qq73WKhHvch0VQtg=`

## Troubleshooting

### If Login Still Fails
1. Check the console output for authentication verification results
2. Ensure the database connection is working
3. Verify the password is entered correctly (case-sensitive)
4. Try the database reset option

### Manual Database Reset
If needed, you can manually reset the database by:
1. Deleting the database file (if using LocalDB)
2. Running the application again to recreate it
3. Or use SQL Server Management Studio to drop and recreate the database

## Future Considerations
- Consider upgrading to a more secure password hashing algorithm like BCrypt or Argon2
- Implement password complexity requirements
- Add account lockout mechanisms for security
